# Team databaes @ Interuni Datathon 2025

## Problem Statement
**AIM:** To find the optimal week and resort for a ski holiday in 2026

Out of 9 possible resorts and 15 possible weeks, we aim to identify the optimal time and place for your 2026 ski holiday! 

However, the databaes recognise that different groups of people have different priorities. As such, we present recommendations catered to two focus groups:
* **Youth:** Taking a break from studies with your friends? Want to hit the slopes and have a really fun time? Interested in your resort's events and nightlife? This focus group is for you!
* **Families:** Travelling with kids? Looking for some time to sit back and unwind? This focus group caters for families 

## Data Sources
**1. visitation_raw.csv**
* This dataset contains measures of each of the 9 resorts' visitation
* It is at a weekly grain for each of the 15 weeks of the ski season each year between 2014 and 2024
* One unit of visitation is equivalent to 12 hours being spent at the resort (either by one individual or multiple people adding up to 12 hours)

**2. climate_raw.csv**
* This dataset contains daily records of maximum temperature, minimum temperate and rainfall over approximately 15 years
* Data for each of 7 weather stations in the skiing regions of Victoria and New South Wales features in this dataset

## File Directory
